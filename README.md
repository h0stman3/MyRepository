## Description
I am new to GitHub and I use this repo for my lab work: I practice commits, Markdown, LaTeX math, code blocks, and adding an image; my goal is to finish university well and build a stable life.

## My studies
I study higher mathematics: calculus, linear algebra, and analytic geometry;Only math and tryhard.

## Online VS offline studying
| Online | Offline |
|---|---|
| Flexible schedule and place | waking up in the morning and go to work😨 |

## My favorite math formulas
Centered formulas with fraction, indices, and Greek letters.

$$ \lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{1}{x}=0 \quad\text{(goes to zero as }x\text{ grows)} $$

$$ \frac{d}{dx}\,(x^3)=3x^2 \quad\text{} $$

$$ \int x^2\,dx=\frac{x^3}{3}+C \quad\text{} $$

$$ \vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}=|a||b|\cos(\theta) \quad\text{}\theta\text{)} $$

$$ A=\pi r^2,\quad \sigma^2=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n}(x_k-\mu)^2,\quad \alpha+\beta=\gamma \quad\text{} $$

## My coding skills
Below i wanna present a minimal C++ program that prints a message; `main()` is the entry point and `return 0` means normal finish.  
Check it here: [Online C++ compiler](https://cpp.sh).

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    cout << "Hello, GitHub!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## The image I like
A place and time I would love to visit — it feels peaceful and cozy.
